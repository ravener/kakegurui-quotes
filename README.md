# Kakegurui Quotes
A project to collect quotes from the anime series Kakegurui and allow easy access to it in data format and a web API.

## TODO
This is very work in progress but here are some of my goals:

- [ ] Track which episode each quote comes from.
- [ ] Track the original Japanese words spoken.
- [ ] A web interface that displays the quotes.
- [ ] More and more quotes.
